The Game of Thrones' House Finder app uses a survey to determine which house in Westros should the user belong to. The user's house is determined by taking the results from a survey and comparing it with the answers already stored on the app for certain family houses. The user that has the closest score to a particular House is considered a match. The app will then display to the user the name, sigil and motto of their house. Which house do you belong to in Westros? Will it be House Stark, House Greyjoy, House Baratheon, House Lannister, or House Targaryen? ...Choose wisely...
